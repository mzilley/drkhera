                Peyronie’s disease is an abnormal curvature of the penis when it is erect.  It is estimated that up to 5-9% of men suffer from Peyronie’s disease.   The average age of onset of this disease is 57 years old and the disease becomes more common as men become older.  The cause of Peyronie’s disease remains unknown.  However, many believe that it is due to blunt penile injury or repeated trauma associated with sexual activity.  Men will present with a plaque or a “knot” in their penis and/or a curvature of their penis.  Significant penile curvatures can result in pain, poor erections, and an inability to engage in sexual intercourse.

                There are 2 phases of Peyronie’s disease.  There is the “active phase” and the “quiet phase.” The active phase occurs first and generally lasts about 6-18 months.  During the active phase many men experience pain with erections.  During the active phase roughly 50% of men will continue to get worse, 35% will stay the same, and 15% will get better on their own.  The quiet phase follows the active phase and is generally not associated with pain with erections.  The quiet phase is also not associated with any further changes in curvature or plaque size.

                Some men may require penile injections with medications (ie. Xiaflex) to reduce the plaque size. Surgical correction and penile straightening procedures are available to men who do not respond to more conservative medical treatments.
