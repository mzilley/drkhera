                Following radial prostatectomy, approximately 30% of patients have erectile dysfunction secondary to vascular and neurogenic causes. Although the cavernosal nerves may be preserved during a radical prostatectomy, a majority of men suffer from neuropraxia, or nerve paralysis, which may last from months to years.  Nerve injury can independently lead to vascular injury and subsequent penile scarring.  This can be a major cause of erectile dysfunction in men following radical prostatectomy.

                The concept of erectile preservation is to increase blood flow and oxygen to the penile tissue and thus prevent scarring and permanent damage to the penis.  It is important to take this proactive approach because many times the scarring that occurs in the penis after a radical prostatectomy is irreversible.

                There are many medications that can be used to prevent penile scarring.  Daily Cialis 5mg can be effective in preserving erectile function.  Approximately 17% of men after a radical prostatectomy have low testosterone levels.  Testosterone is responsible for increasing a manâ€™s libido but can also help with improving penile nerve conduction and erections.    Finally, some men may go on to penile injection therapy in order to provide them with erections sufficient for intercourse.  This involves inserting a small needle into the side of the penis and injection medication which increases the blood flow into the penis.  The use of a vacuum erection device (VED) on a daily basis has been shown to increase blood flow and oxygen to the penis as well as preserve penile length.

                If medical therapy is ineffective, men have the option of a penile prosthesis.  This device was invented here at Baylor College of Medicine and has significantly advanced the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Satisfaction rates have been greater than 90% from both the male patients and their partners.
