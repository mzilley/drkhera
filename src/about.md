He subsequently earned his Masters Degree in Business Administration and his Masters Degree in Public Health from Boston University. He received his Medical Degree from The University of Texas Medical School at San Antonio and completed his Urology residency training in the Scott Department of Urology at Baylor College of Medicine. At Baylor, he completed a one-year general surgery internship and then went on to complete a five-year residency program in Urology.  After completing his Urology residency, he went on to complete a one-year fellowship in Male Reproductive Medicine and Surgery at Baylor.  Currently he is a Professor in the Scott Department of Urology at Baylor College of Medicine and he holds the F. Brantley Scott Chair in Urology. Dr. Khera specializes in male and female sexual dysfunction, Men’s Health and hormone replacement therapy. Dr. Khera also serves as the Director of the Laboratory for Andrology Research, the Medical Director of the Baylor Executive Health Program and the Medical Director of the Scott Department of Urology.  He also serves as President-Elect of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America. 

Dr. Khera has dedicated his clinical and research efforts to three main areas:  Men’s Health, sexual medicine, and hormone replacement therapy.  Soon after completing my fellowship he started the Laboratory for Andrology Research. His laboratory focuses on basic science research and he has had the opportunity to train many residents and research fellows over the past 12 years.  In addition to his basic science research, he has initiated numerous FDA approved clinical trials.  His basic science and clinic experiences have allowed him to thus far give over 250 lectures at scientific meetings throughout the world, publish over 120 articles in peer reviewed journals, complete 15 book chapters, and edit and write two books all in the field of sexual medicine and Men’s Health.  

In 2007 he was awarded the American Urologic Association (AUA) Research Scholars Award to study the correlation between ED and BPH.    In 2013 he was elected to serve a 4 year term on the American Urologic Society Examination Committee.  Dr. Khera has also served on the AUA Peyronie’s Disease and Erectile Dysfunction Guidelines Panel.  For the past several years he has taught numerous course in testosterone therapy and sexual dysfunction nationally and throughout the world.
