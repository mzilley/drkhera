  peyroniesDisease:
    heading4: Peyronie's Disease
    conditionDesc4: >
      Peyronie’s disease is an abnormal curvature of the penis when it is erect.
      It is estimated that up to 5-9% of men suffer from Peyronie’s disease. The
      average age of onset of this disease is 57 years old and the disease
      becomes more common as men become older. The cause of Peyronie’s disease
      remains unknown. However, many believe that it is due to blunt penile
      injury or repeated trauma associated with sexual activity. Men will
      present with a plaque or a “knot” in their penis and/or a curvature of
      their penis. Significant penile curvatures can result in pain, poor
      erections, and an inability to engage in sexual intercourse.

      of the spermatic cord procedure can be helpful.

  testimonial1:
    testimonialContent1: I was experiencing infertility with an almost non existent
      sperm count. After seeing several urologists over several months the
      answer was always the same, that I am infertile and if we wanted to have a
      child we would have to do IVF. None of them were able to determine what
      caused this.After finding doctor Khera, he not only identified the issue
      and increased my sperm count from 15(just 15 out of what should be 20+
      million) but found the root of the problem and corrected it! I now have a
      good count and can conceive naturally.Dr. Khera has a wonderful bedside
      manner, he is attentive and addresses all possibilities. I was sure that
      there was no hope until I came to him.

    testimonialContent2: Dr. Khera is one of the top Urologists in the US. He does
      extensive research and has developed the different medicines I have used
      over the years. I have been seeing him for almost 10 years and highly
      recommend him. Dr. Khera has the best "bed side manners" of any doctor I
      have ever gone to. He genuinely cares about each of his patients.

  testimonial3:
    testimonialContent3: My urologist for 5 years. I have a huge level of trust
      Excellent doctor. Heavily involved in research so he is current on
      treatment options. Easy to talk with about difficult personal issues.
      Great staff. Basil, his PA, is also great. I never feel rushed and unlike
      other reviews, I seldom wait past my appointment time. Great communication
      through BCM MyChart. Test results with his comments appear in 1-3 days.
      Just did a TURP on my prostate a few weeks ago and no side effects,
      although he carefully went over all the possibilities and likelihood. He
      has been great as I have dealt ED since a less successful microwave
      prostate treatment years ago. So glad I was referred to Dr. Khera and I
      refer friends, coworkers and their spouses.
